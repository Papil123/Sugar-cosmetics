Introduction
I was trying to build An E-Commerce website for my Project Of Masai. I had given a task to Replicate The SugarCosmetics.com Website Using HTML,CSS and ReactJS. I have used this Teach Stacks to build a responsiveness website as like SugarCosmetics and for the different screen sizes like Mobile, I pad & Large screens.

How we Build the Project
I started the project with planning how to Build It more responsive to the users as a real one .I came up with different ideas of putting all the functionalities of the website but in short-time I couldn't do it .so I made it as responsive as could made it , within Five days of time period. I was able to identify all the problem one shall face while building the project and had necessary guidelines in place which would help us move forward step by step rather than jumping and opening many things at a time.

Outcomes
To be able to work on a project the individual must possess leadership qualities, he/she should be able to contribute ideas and be confident to over come challenges . Overall, it was a surreal experience, and I look forward to many such challenges.
